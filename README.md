# Savior App

One of the great ideas that came up is the idea of this application!

In light of the problems and dispersion we are currently in, we are no longer able to make a right decision. So I created this application to help anyone make a decision from the experts, where the person publishes a post about the problem. Then several people publish a solution to this problem! And according to the number of endorsements and likes, the correct decision is calculated.

A section has also been added to the polls in the event that you have more than one decision and do not know which of these decisions is the correct one. It is possible to publish a poll about the problem and with it several decisions or options, and then the most accurate decision is calculated by voting.
